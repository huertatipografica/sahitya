Alegreya Devanagari
===================

This file provides detailed information on the *Alegreya Devanagari* font
software.

This information should be distributed along with the  Alegreya fonts and any
derivative works.

### Basic Font Information

Alegreya was chosen as one of 53 "Fonts of the Decade" at the ATypI Letter2
competition in September 2011, and one of the top 14 text type systems. It was
also selected in the 2nd Bienal Iberoamericana de Diseño, competition held in
Madrid in 2010.

Alegreya is a typeface originally intended for literature. Among its crowning
characteristics, it conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm which facilitates the
reading of long texts. Also, it provides freshness to the page while referring
to the calligraphic letter, not as a literal interpretation, but rather in a
contemporary typographic language.

The italic has just as much care and attention to detail in the design as the
roman. The bold weights are strong, and the Black weights are really
experimental for the genre. There is also a Small Caps sister family.

Not only does Alegreya provide great performance, but also achieves a strong and
harmonious text by means of elements designed in an atmosphere of diversity.

The Alegreya type system is a "super family", originally intended for
literature, and includes serif and [sans
serif](<http://www.huertatipografica.com/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht>) sister
families.
